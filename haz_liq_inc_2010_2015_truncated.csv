CENTRAL, A 10 INCH PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM MAIN PASS PLATFORM 41 TO EMPIRE (APPROXIMATELY 12 MILES SOUTHEAST OF EMPIRE, LA.) FAILED DURING LINE LOWERING OPERATIONS, RESULTING IN A RELEASE OF APPROXIMATELY [79] BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL.  BOOM WAS DEPLOYED BY THE BARGE CREW AND CHEVRON CONTROL CENTER INITIATED REMOTE SHUT DOWN OF THE PUMPS.  CPL OPERATORS AT THE EMPIRE TERMINAL WERE DISPATCHED TO MANUALLY BLOCK-IN THE VALVES CLOSEST TO THE LEAK SITE AT EMPIRE TERMINAL AND GRAND BAY RECEIVING STATION.      SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL FACT GATHERING AND ANALYSIS AS MAY BE REQUIRED, THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION RESULTS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW:                 ¿ THE 10 INCH PIPELINE WAS INSTALLED IN 1953 TO TRANSPORT CRUDE FROM MAIN PASS PLATFORM 41 TO EMPIRE TERMINAL.                 ¿ IN JULY 2009, SEVERAL SEGMENTS OF THE 10 INCH PIPELINE WERE EVALUATED PER 49CFR 195.413 AND DETERMINED TO HAVE INSUFFICIENT DEPTH OF COVER.  CPL APPLIED FOR PERMITS TO LOWER THOSE SEGMENTS AND THE FAILURE OCCURRED DURING JETTING OPERATIONS TO LOWER THE LINE.                 ¿ THE 10 INCH PIPELINE HAD DENTS AT FIVE LOCATIONS, APPARENTLY CAUSED BY BOAT AND BARGE TRAFFIC IN THE AREA, AND THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT ONE OF THESE DENTS.  THE DENTS WERE NOT VISIBLE AND UT WAS NOT CAPABLE OF DETECTING THEM.  CPL WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PRIOR DENTS OR WHEN THEY OCCURRED.                 ¿ METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PIPELINE MATERIAL INDICATED BRITTLE AND INFLEXIBLE STEEL WITH NIL FRACTURE TOUGHNESS.  THE STEEL WAS COMMON FOR PIPELINES INSTALLED IN 1953.                   ¿ THE FAILURE OCCURRED DURING LOWING OPERATIONS BY CHEVRON¿S CONTRACTOR, SUNLAND CONSTRUCTION.  BASED ON WITNESS INTERVIEWS, IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTRACTOR CUT TRENCHES OF TWO TO FOUR FEET ON THE DAY OF THE FAILURE.  IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THE FAILURE RELATED TO OR RESULTED FROM THE TRENCH DEPTH.    THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT FOT THE ACCIDENT.

(THIS WAS IN A SEPARATE, ADJACENT LOCATION FROM WHERE THE EXCAVATION WORK WAS LOCATED; WORK ON THE DIG WAS SUSPENDED WHEN THE WEEP WAS SIGHTED.)     THE PURPOSE OF THE ISOLATION FITTING WAS TO ELECTRICALLY ISOLATE THE MAINLINE AND FACILITY PIPING CATHODIC PROTECTION SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL CORROSION PROTECTION. THIS FITTING WAS INSTALLED DURING INITIAL CONSTRUCTION. CURRENTLY, THE ISOLATION FITTING IS NOT NEEDED DUE TO UPGRADES TO THE CATHODIC PROTECTION SYSTEMS, AND IT HAS BEEN ELECTRICALLY BYPASSED. PS10 HAS BEEN OUT OF SERVICE SINCE 1998 AND WAS STRAIGHT PIPED IN 2013.     INITIAL REPORTS CONCERNING THE WEEP WERE THAT THE SUBSTANCE WAS POTENTIALLY CRUDE AND A SPILL REPORT WAS FILED. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT (LEL) GAS MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF TAR-BASED PACKING MATERIAL IN THE ISOLATION FITTING, THE PRECISE NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE WAS INITIALLY UNCLEAR. THUS ALYESKA SENT A SAMPLE OF THE SUBSTANCE FROM PS10 AND A SAMPLE OF NORTH SLOPE CRUDE OUT FOR A LABORATORY ANALYSIS. TEST RESULTS RECEIVED JUNE 4, 2015, INDICATE THE WEEPING MOISTURE ON THE ISOLATION FLANGE AT PS10 IS WEATHERED CRUDE OIL.     INITIALLY, THE WEEP RATE WAS ABOUT ONE DRIP PER SECOND, APPARENTLY DUE TO THE ACCUMULATION OF CRUDE WITHIN THE TAR MEMBRANE/PACKING MATERIAL WITHIN THE FITTING. THE ORIGINAL WEEP LATER STOPPED ON ITS OWN, BUT THERE IS NOW ADDITIONAL MINOR WEEPING. ALYESKA HAS EXCAVATED APPROXIMATELY 5 YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL. ALL EXCAVATION HAS BEEN DONE BY HAND THUS FAR. THERE IS NO INDICATION HOW LONG THE WEEP HAS BEEN ACTIVE AND THE TOTAL VOLUME EXTRUDED IS UNCERTAIN.      TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS FOR REPAIR AND REMEDIATION ARE BEING EVALUATED. CONTINGENCY SPILL MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE, INCLUDING 24-HOUR SITE MONITORING; SECONDARY CONTAINMENT (PIPE CAP); STAGING OF A CREW WITH A VAC TRUCK; AND PLACEMENT OF AN RB-100 (ACTUATOR) AND GENERATOR ON-SITE FOR CONTINGENCY CLOSURE OF THE VALVE.   PROTOCOLS ARE ALSO BEING DEVELOPED FOR ASSESSMENT OF OTHER ISOLATION FITTINGS (21) LOCATED ALONG THE TAPS SYSTEM.     UPDATE: ON JULY 13, 2015, A 60-INCH CONTAINMENT SLEEVE WITH GROUT INJECTION AND SEAL WELDING OF PLUGS WAS COMPLETED. THE WEEP IS REPAIRED THOUGH ALYESKA HAS FINAL INSTALLATION OF CONICAL ENDS FOR THE SLEEVE SCHEDULED FOR THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2015. ALYESKA HAS CONTRACTED STRESS ENGINEERING TO CONDUCT A CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR THIS EVENT. ALYESKA CONTINUES INVESTIGATIONS OF OTHER ISOLATION FITTINGS ON TAPS TO ENSURE NO OTHER FAILURES HAVE OCCURRED. TO DATE, SEPTEMBER 10, 2015, NO ADDITIONAL LEAKS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.     UPDATE: THE CONICAL ENDS INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2015.

THE FACILITY CONTAINS A 10¿ CRUDE OIL TRUNK LINE AND PIPELINE PUMPS AS WELL AS A BREAKOUT TANK AND TANK TRUCK LOADING OPERATIONS.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE PIPELINE AND TANK TRUCK LOADING OPERATIONS WERE IN-SERVICE AND CONSTRUCTION WAS ON-GOING ON THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE FACILITY.    ON APRIL 21, 2016 AT APPROXIMATELY 0630 A CONSTRUCTION OPERATOR ARRIVING AT THE HOWARD FACILITY DISCOVERED A 1¿ NIPPLE ON THE DISCHARGE LINE FROM A TEMPORARY FACILITY PUMP WAS LEAKING AND SPRAYING CRUDE OIL INTO THE AIR.  THE CONSTRUCTION OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED A MEDALLION OPERATOR AND BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY TO STOP THE RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL.  ONCE THE PUMP WAS SHUT DOWN AND THE RELEASE STOPPED A CALL WAS MADE TO MEDALLION¿S REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE MANAGER AT 0725 ON APRIL 21, 2016.    THE TEMPORARY PUMP IS BEING USED UNTIL THE MAINLINE PUMPS ARE COMMISSIONED.  THE COMMISSIONING IS EXPECTED BEFORE JUNE 1, 2016.  THE TEMPORARY PUMP IS EQUIPPED WITH PRESSURE SWITCHES FOR HIGH PRESSURE AND LOW PRESSURE SHUT DOWN IF THE SUCTION OR DISCHARGE MOVE BEYOND THE DESIRED OPERATING PRESSURE.      AFTER THE INITIAL RESPONSE TO STOP THE RELEASE, MEDALLION IDENTIFIED THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE TO BE A CRACK IN THE THREADS OF A 1¿ NIPPLE.  AN INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE NIPPLE THAT FAILED HAD CRACKED DUE TO VIBRATION ON THE LINE RESULTING IN A MIST OIL BEING SPRAYED INTO THE AIR AND RELEASING A TOTAL 40 BBLS OF OIL ONTO THE GROUND, IMPACTING APPROXIMATELY 4000 CUBIC FEET OF SOIL.  SINCE THE NIPPLE DID NOT FAIL COMPLETELY THE LINE MAINTAINED PRESSURE AND PREVENTED THE LOW PRESSURE SHUT DOWN FROM SHUTTING DOWN THE PUMP BEFORE THE FIRST PERSON ARRIVED ON LOCATION AND DISCOVERED THE RELEASE.    THE FACILITY REMAINED IN OPERATION DURING INITIAL RESPONSE AND CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES.  THE PUMP AFFECTED BY THE CRACKED NIPPLE WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE BROKEN NIPPLE ALONG WITH ALL OTHER NIPPLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUMP WERE REPLACED AND THE PUMP WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE AROUND 1800 ON APRIL 21, 2016.    MEDALLION BEGAN REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES TO REMOVE THE RELEASED CRUDE OIL AND IDENTIFY THE EXTENT OF THE RELEASE.  MOST OF THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE REMAINED ON MEDALLION¿S SITE; HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY THREE ACRES OF CROP LAND ADJACENT TO THE SITE WAS IMPACTED BY A MIST OF PRODUCT THAT WAS SPRAYED IN THE AIR.  THERE WERE NO CROPS PLANTED AT THE TIME AND ONLY THE SOIL WAS IMPACTED.  DUE TO RAIN ACTIVITY THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RELEASED CRUDE OIL MIXED WITH STANDING WATER.  CREWS WORKED TO CLEAN EQUIPMENT WITH STEAM POWER WASHERS AND COLLECT THE FREE STANDING WATER AND CRUDE OIL WITH VACUUM TRUCKS.  APPROXIMATELY 85 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, WATER AND SOILED WERE REMOVED BY THE VACUUM TRUCK.  ADDITIONALLY, A BACKHOE WAS USED TO SCRAPE UP AFFECTED SOIL PLACED IT ONTO A PLASTIC LINER THAT HAD BEEN BERMED TO PREVENT RUNOFF.

(R&M) ENTERED THE WEST YARD SECTION OF THE PHILADELPHIA REFINERY AND DISCOVERED A RELEASE OF HEAVY OIL AROUND A VALVE MANIFOLD WHICH CONNECTS THE FM-1 PIPELINE TO THE N-8 PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED SUNOCO PERSONNEL AND A RESPONSE WAS INITIATED.  THE VACUUM GAS OIL (VGO) TRANSFER WAS SHUTDOWN AT 14:00 HOURS AND, DUE TO THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF THE PRODUCT, THE HEAVY MATERIAL WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPLACED FROM THE PIPELINE WITH LIGHT CYCLE OIL (LCO) AND ISOLATED BY 18:00 HOURS.    ON 4/5/2010, THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN A FLANGED CONNECTION ON THE FM-1 PIG TRAP, NORMALLY ISOLATED, EXCEPT DURING PIGGING ACTIVITY.  THE PIG TRAP WAS LAST USED DURING AN IN-LINE INSPECTION CONDUCTED ON JUNE 23, 2008.  A MORE THOROUGH EVALUATION WILL BE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE FAILURE MECHANISM THAT RESULTED IN THE RELEASE FROM THE FLANGED CONNECTION.    A HYDROCHEM (VACUUM TRUCK) EMPLOYEE, WHO ROUTINELY MONITORED AND MANAGED RESIDUAL OIL THAT ACCUMULATED IN REFINERY SUMPS, INCLUDING THE WEST YARD VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT, REPORTED THAT OIL ACCUMULATION APPEARED TO INTENSIFY AND WAS FOUND OUTSIDE THE VAULT BEGINNING ABOUT 3/15/2010.  THIS WAS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY TYPICAL RESIDUAL GROUND SEEPAGE EXACERBATED BY EXCESSIVE RAINFALL AND SNOW THAW.  OPERATIONS TURNOVER REPORTS FROM 3/15/10 TO 3/25/10 HAVE ONLY ONE REPORT OF HEAVY OIL ON WATER (3/18/10).  THIS AGAIN WAS REMOVED BY HYDROCHEM VACUUM TRUCKS.   ON THE MORNING OF 3/16/2010 , TWO SUNOCO EMPLOYEES WERE IN THE WEST YARD FOR TRAINING PURPOSES AND DID NOT NOTICE A LEAK OR HEAVY OIL AT THAT TIME.  ON 3/24/2010 AT 11:00 HOURS, ANOTHER SUNOCO EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE WEST YARD AND DID NOT REPORT A RELEASE AT THAT TIME.    IN ADDITION, ON 3/24 AT 13:37 HOURS, A HYDROCHEM EMPLOYEE ENTERED THE WEST YARD TO VACUUM RESIDUAL OIL FROM THE VALVE MANIFOLD VAULT.  THE RELEASE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE 24 HOURS PRIOR TO DISCOVERY.    A TOTAL OF 1,700 BARRELS WAS RELEASED AND NEARLY ALL OF THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN RECOVERED.    5/19/2010 UPDATE:  THE FM-1 PIG TRAP WAS ABOUT 39 1/2¿ IN LENGTH, MEASURED FROM THE FLANGE AT THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE TO THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS INITIALLY SUPPORTED AT THREE LOCATIONS.  THE TRAP WAS SUPPORTED AT THE CONTAINMENT WALL AROUND THE MANIFOLD, 9¿-4¿ FROM THE FLANGE AT THE CLOSURE.  THE TRAP WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ITS FLANGED CONNECTION TO THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  DUE TO ITS LENGTH, IT WAS ALSO SUPPORTED, ADJACENT TO THE FAILED CENTER FLANGE.  THE CENTER FLANGE WAS 5¿-0¿ FROM THE INLET/OUTLET VALVE.  THE CENTER SUPPORT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN LOCATED IN THE 5¿ SPOOL, WITHIN 12¿ FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.  THE SUPPORT CONSISTED OF A STRUCTURAL COLUMN, A BASE PLATE AT THE BOTTOM THAT RESTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE MANIFOLD CONTAINMENT, AND A TWO-PART CLAMP-STYLE FITTING AT THE TOP WHICH SECURED THE SUPPORT TO THE OUTSIDE DIAMETER OF THE CARRIER PIPE.  ONCE THE FM-1 TRAP WAS REMOVED, THE CENTER SUPPORT WAS FOUND IN THE CONTAINMENT, DETACHED AND SEPARATED FROM THE FM-1 TRAP PIPING.    IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE LACK OF SUPPORT AT THE CENTER FLANGE, ALLOWED PIPE MOVEMENT OVER TIME, INCLUDING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THERMAL CYCLING, WHICH APPLIED A DIFFERENTIAL STRESS ON THE FLANGE BOLTS AND EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE FLANGE TO OPEN AT THE 8:00 O¿CLOCK POSITION.  THE FM-1 TRAP INLET/OUTLET VALVE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A MECHANICAL DEFECT WHICH PREVENTED A TIGHT SHUT-OFF, WHICH ALLOWED PRODUCT FROM THE FM-1 PIPELINE TRANSFER TO PASS THROUGH THE VALVE, INTO THE PIG TRAP, CAUSING THE RELEASE FROM THE CENTER FLANGE.

ENBRIDGE THEN HUNG UP THE CALL AND CALLED AGAIN AT WHICH TIME IT WAS ON HOLD FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF TIME.  THE STATED 13:33 REFLECTS THE TIME THAT ENBRIDGE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE VERBAL NOTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT.    THE RELEASE WAS INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT 19,500 BARRELS OF WHICH AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT ENTERED THE TALMADGE CREEK AND ULTIMATELY THE KALAMAZOO RIVER.  THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED PRODUCT RELEASED IN OR REACHING WATER HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED AND IS BASED UPON A CALCULATION PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL CONSULTANT.

ENBRIDGE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES TO CALCULATE THIS VOLUME, AND WILL COMMUNICATE THE METHODOLOGY AND SUBSEQUENT VOLUME TO PHMSA UPON COMPLETION.     THE SECTION THAT FAILED HAS BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF NTSB. PENDING THE RESULTS OF METALLURGICAL TESTING AND FAILURE INVESTIGATIONS, ENBRIDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND FINAL DATA FOR THIS ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMISSION. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT IS TO BE CONSIDERED ESTIMATED UNTIL SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORTS ARE FILED. NTSB, PHMSA AND ENBRIDGE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS ACCIDENT HAVE COMMENCED. AS THIS INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CAUSE(S) HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED.    TO DATE, ENBRIDGE HAS NOT FOUND ANY POTABLE WATER SOURCES (PUBLIC OR PRIVATE) WITH DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN VERIFIABLY LINKED TO THE ENBRIDGE RELEASE. THE ASSESSMENT OF ALL DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AFFECTED AREA IS ONGOING. ENBRIDGE IS IN THE PROCESS OF SAMPLING DRINKING WATER SOURCES AND IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN EVALUATING DRINKING WATER FROM POTABLE WELLS TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH.    ENBRIDGE ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION. THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE, COSTS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE AND RELATED INSPECTION COSTS, POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, AND LOST REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LEAK AND ITS REMEDIATION, HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SPECIFIC DETAIL REQUESTED IN THIS FORM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORTS.

THE TESTING AND ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED ALONG THE LONG SEAM WELD IN AN AREA WITH REDUCED WALL THICKNESS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION. THE AREAS OF EXTERNAL CORROSION ON THE PIPE CORRESPONDED TO AREAS OF COATING DISBONDMENT ALONG THE 9:00 ORIENTATION AND 3:00 ORIENTATION OF THE 16 DEGREE BEND IN THE PIPE AT THE FAILURE LOCATION. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF PREFERENTIAL CORROSION AT THE LONG SEAM WELD (GROOVING CORROSION) AT THE ORIGIN OF THE FAILURE.

THE TOTAL VOLUME OF PRODUCT RELEASED TO THE SOILS IS CALCULATED AT 41 GALLONS. AN INCIDENT ANALYSIS OF THIS EVENT WAS CONDUCTED ON 1/7/2016. THE BASIC CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS CONFIRMED AS THE FLATTENING OF INTERIOR O-RINGS ON THE CHECK VALVE SPRING ASSEMBLIES DUE TO NORMAL WEAR. THE DESIGN OF THE SPRING ASSEMBLY/SPRING COVER WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR SINCE IT INCLUDES A GAP BETWEEN THE MAIN VALVE BODY AND THE SPRING ASSEMBLY.  AS SUCH, THE SPRING ASSEMBLY COVER IS AN INEFFECTIVE PRESSURE CONTAINMENT DEVICE. THE WHEATLEY CHECK VALVE IN QUESTION IS UNIQUE TO THE OPERATING AREA.  CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IDENTIFIED DURING THE INCIDENT ANALYSIS PROCESS INCLUDE: 1) DETERMINE IF OTHER VALVES WITHIN THE COMPANY ARE OF THE SAME DESIGN. 2)CONTACT THE VALVE MANUFACTURER FOR AN EXISTING SOLUTION FOR THE CONTAINMENT ISSUE OR DESIGN AN IN-HOUSE SOLUTION THAT COULD BE MANUFACTURED BY A MACHINE SHOP. 3)IF A CONTAINMENT SOLUTION CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED, INCORPORATE ACCESS WELLS INTO THE BACKFILL EFFORTS SO THAT PERIODIC CHECKS COULD BE CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO QUICKLY DETECT ANY LOSS OF CONTAINMENT FROM THE CHECK VALVE IN THE FUTURE.",EQUIPMENT FAILURE,,REFINED AND/OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT (NON-HVL) WHICH IS A LIQUID AT AMBIENT CONDITIONS,11/23/15 10:30,COLONIAL PIPELINE CO,12/21/15,3.69,-79.93687,36.07129

AT THIS TIME IT WAS SUSPECTED THIS STATION PIPE TO BE THE SOURCE AND THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE THE LINE. DUE TO THE DEPTH OF PIPE AND LIMITED SPACE OF THE SITE, THE 6¿ STATION PIPE WAS CUT IN HALF AND REMOVED IN ORDER TO VISUALLY INSPECT THE PIPE (COMPLETED ON 3/16).   UPON VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE PIPE AFTER REMOVAL, A LEAK SOURCE WAS NOT APPARENT.  NEW PIPE WAS INSTALLED ON 3/13 @ 20:00. ONEOK THAN BEGAN FURTHER ACTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE HYDROCARBONS. 3 ACTIVITIES WERE UNDERTAKEN: 1) EXCAVATION OF STOPPLE TEES, TIE-IN WELDS, FITTINGS, AND NEW PIPING INSTALLED ON STERLING PIPELINES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF PRAIRIE VIEW SITE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2014, 2) THE SHUT DOWN AND PRESSURE MONITORING OF PIPELINES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SITE, STERLING 1, STERLING 2 AND MADILL LATERAL, AND 3) HYDROTESTING OF THE REMOVED SECTION OF PIPE.   #1:  ALL PIPELINE DITCHES ENTERING PRAIRIE VIEW JUNCTION WERE EVALUATED FOR ANY PRODUCT THAT MAY HAVE MIGRATED INTO THE SITE FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE.

THE CONTROL CENTER SHUT DOWN LINES 6A, 14, 13, AND 61 IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  ENBRIDGE STAFF WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO THE AREA.  OIL FROM THE RELEASE MIGRATED INTO NEAR-BY STORM WATER AND SEPTIC SEWER SYSTEMS, AND REACHED BOTH A LOCAL STORM WATER RETENTION POND AND WATER TREATMENT PLANT.  LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS, EPA, NTSB AND PHMSA RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT AND WERE ONSITE DURING THE EXCAVATION, REPAIR AND LINE-FILL OF LINE 6A. DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THIS LEAK TO A NUMBER OF LOCAL BUSINESSES, ROMEOVILLE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICIALS ADVISED APPROXIMATELY 470 PEOPLE TO VACATE THE AREA DURING THE INITIAL PHASES OF THE RESPONSE TO FACILITATE SITE ACCESS AND CONTAINMENT EFFORTS. ENBRIDGE ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $40 AND $60 MILLION EXCLUSIVE OF FINES AND PENALTIES. THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE, COSTS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE AND RELATED INSPECTION COSTS, POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES AND LOST REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LEAK AND ITS REMEDIATION, HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SPECIFIC DETAIL REQUESTED IN THIS FORM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORTS. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NTSB, THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE AND THE WATER LINE THAT WAS WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY HAVE BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  PENDING THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL TESTING AND FAILURE INVESTIGATION, ENBRIDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND FINAL DATA REGARDING CAUSE FOR THIS ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMISSION.    VOLUME OF CRUDE OIL RELEASED FROM THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN REVISED TO THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATES:  7,538 BARRELS, WITH 7,538 RECOVERED AND 1,131 BARRELS REACHING AN UNNAMED DRAIN AND RETENTION POND. THE 7,538 BBLS IS THE ESIMATED AMOUNT RECOVERED IN TANKAGE AND MAY NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL OIL RECOVERED IN WASTE STREAMS.      ENBRIDGE CONTINUES TO WORK THROUGH THE SITE REMEDIATION PROGRAM WITH THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (IEPA).  THE REMEDIAL OBJECTIVES REPORT (ROR)/RESPONSE ACTION PLAN (RAP) WAS APPROVED BY THE IEPA AND THE RAP HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE SITE.  THE ENBRIDGE ENVIRONMENT GROUP MEETS ANNUALLY WITH THE IEPA TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT DIRECTION.  GROUND WATER AND SURFACE WATER WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS.  SINCE THE INITIAL RELEASE, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY DETECTIONS ABOVE CRITERIA IN EITHER THE GROUND OR SURFACE WATER.  WE ARE CURRENTLY MONITORING A NETWORK OF 30 MONITORING WELLS AND 5 SURFACE WATER LOCATIONS ON A COMBINED QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.

AT 16:55 LOCAL TIME COUNTRYMARK PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE SPILL WAS INDEED THE ALBION LINE LEAKING SO COUNTRYMARK CONTINUED THE EMERGENCY OPERATION AT FULL SPEED.  OVER THE NEXT 5 DAYS CLEAN-UP PROCEEDED UNTIL ALL OF THE SHEEN ON THE RIVER HAD BEEN REMOVED AND ALL OF THE CONTAMINATED VEGETATION ALONG THE RIVER BANKS WAS PICKED UP FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.  WILD LIFE INCLUDING BIRDS AND FISH WERE MONITORED ALL DURING THE CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS FINAL REPORT.  NO EVIDENCE OF HARM TO WILDLIFE WAS FOUND.  COUNTRYMARK AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FINAL REPORT HAS COLLECTED 39 CUBIC YARDS OF OIL CONTAMINATED DEBRIS, INCLUDING ABSORBENTS, VEGETATION, AND FLOATING TIMBER.  CONTINUING INSPECTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN POSITIVE RESULTS AND WE HAVE NOT FOUND ADDITIONAL OIL OR OIL CONTAMINATED DEBRIS SINCE THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PRELIMINARY REPORT.    AT THE DATE AND TIME OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT COUNTRYMARK WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OR EXACT LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE LEAK BECAUSE OF EXTREMELY HIGH WATER IN THE RIVER AND IN THE BACKWATERS OF THE RIVER.  THE NECESSARY WORK SITE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO PIPELINE WORK CREWS FOR PIPELINE EXCAVATION AND INSPECTION WORK AT THE SUSPECTED LEAK LOCATION.  AS SOON AS THE WEATHER AND WATER CONDITIONS PERMITTED COUNTRYMARK INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL CAUSE AND LOCATION.  RESULTS OF THAT INVESTIGATION INDICATED THROUGH ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS SUBSTANTIATED BY FIELD EXAMINATION AND METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY (IMR TEST LABS), THAT A FATIGUE CRACK DEVELOPED CAUSING A SMALL LEAK.  A THIRD PARTY DIVE SURVEY DETERMINED THAT A CONTRIBUTING ""ROOT"" CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE WAS DUE TO AN EXPANDED SEGMENT OF THE PIPE BEING OUT IN THE CURRENT DUE TO EARTH MOVEMENT.  THE RECENT FLOODING HAD APPARENTLY CAUSED A WASHOUT OF THE RIVERBED ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE LOCATION.  IT WAS INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE PIPELINE WEIGHT MOORINGS HAD BROKEN FROM THE PIPELINE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE BENDING LOADS/STRESSES ON THE PIPE.    COUNTRYMARK HAS MADE THE NECESSARY REPLACEMENT WORK BORING A NEW PIPE BELOW THE RIVER BOTTOM IN ORDER TO PUT THE PIPELINE BACK INTO SERVICE.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE WORK ON UNIT 3, THE TECHNICIAN NOTICED STAINED GRAVEL AROUND A BURIED DRAIN VALVE ON THE SUCTION SIDE OF UNIT 1.  SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AROUND THE DRAIN VALVE.  SHEARED BOLTS WERE OBSERVED ON THE BODY OF THE VALVE WHICH CAUSED THE VALVE TO SEPARATE AND LEAK.  THE STATION WAS ISOLATED AND SKILLETS WERE INSTALLED AROUND THE VALVE TO STOP THE LEAK. APPROXIMATELY 40 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WERE REMOVED FROM THE EXCAVATED AREA.  THE IMPACTED SOIL WAS SET ASIDE FOR DISPOSAL.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ENTERED THE SUB-SURFACE DRAIN WHICH LEADS TO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  ON JANUARY 8, 2014 CREWS EXCAVATED IMPACTED SOILS AROUND THE AFFECTED SUB-SURFACE DRAIN LINES.  WATER WAS USED TO FLUSH 73 GALLONS OF RESIDUAL PRODUCT FROM THE DRAIN LINE INTO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  PRODUCT COLLECTED FROM THE EXCAVATION AND OIL/WATER SEPARATOR WAS RETURNED TO THE SYSTEM VIA THE STATION SUMP.   IMPACTS TO THE DRAIN SYSTEM AND SURFICIAL SOILS WERE ADDRESSED.  FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES WERE SCHEDULED TO CONFIRM THAT NO PRODUCT REMAINED IN THE SUBSURFACE DRAIN SYSTEM AND EVALUATE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER IMPACTS AT DEPTH BELOW THE EXCAVATION AROUND THE VALVE.    ON JANUARY 10, 2014 A VAC TRUCK AND CREW BEGAN INSTALLING BORINGS IN THE AREA OF THE VALVE TO ASSESS ADDITIONAL IMPACTS AT DEPTH.  TWO BORINGS BENEATH THE RELEASE AREA REVEALED FREE PRODUCT IN A SANDY LAYER OF SOIL APPROXIMATELY 11 FEET DEEP.  THE VAC TRUCK INSERTED STINGER PIPES INTO THE BORINGS AND REMOVED THE FREE PRODUCT.  SEVERE WEATHER WAS ANTICIPATED AND THE BORINGS WERE ALLOWED TO RECHARGE TO SEE IF PRODUCT RETURNED.

THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT SINCE BEFORE MIDNIGHT SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012 AFTER A LOSS IN PRESSURE  WAS IDENTIFIED ON THE SYSTEMS  SCADA.  THE LA STATE POLICE HAZMAT  HOT LINE,  NRC,  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND OTHER AGENCIES WERE  NOTIFIED.  THE OIL FROM THE NORTH LINE CRUDE PIPELINE WAS CONTAINED IN THE IMMEDIATE  AREA AND RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE INITIATED USING VACUUM TRUCKS, SKIMMERS AND ABSORBENT MATERIALS TO RECOVER  THE OIL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. AIR QUALITY MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE IMPACTED AREA AND CONFIRMED NO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC.  THE CLEANUP WAS COORDINATED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE LOUISIANA OIL SPILL RESPONSE COORDINATOR¿S OFFICE, THE LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE AFFECTED PIPE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AS PART OF A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,891 BARRELS OF OIL WAS PROVIDED TO REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  ONCE THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE, THE SPILL VOLUME ESTIMATE  AND RECOVERED AMOUNT WILL BE UPDATED.  TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED.  THE NORTH LINE   PIPELINE ORIGINATES IN ST. JAMES, LOUISIANA AND CARRIES CRUDE OIL TO THE NORTHERN PART OF LOUISIANA.  CUSTOMERS  WERE BEEN NOTIFIED AND EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TO MINIMIZE  ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS.

ELEMENT REACHED ITS CONCLUSION BASED UPON: VISUAL EXAMINATION, ULTRASONIC TESTING, METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION, HARDNESS TESTS, CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, TENSION TESTS, AND CHARPY TESTS.  VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE REVEALED A ¿SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE ALONG THE INSIDE HALF OF THE FRACTURE FOR A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES, STARTING APPROXIMATELY 6-1/2 INCHES FROM THE GIRTH WELD.¿   THE FLAT FRACTURE WAS ¿PERPENDICULAR TO THE PIPE SURFACES AND TRANSITIONED TO THE SLANTED FRACTURE [FEATURE] FOR THE REMAINING 2-1/2 INCHES TO THE GIRTH WELD.¿   THE FRACTOGRAPHY INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE INITIATED IN THE SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE AND PROPAGATED IN BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM DIRECTIONS. THE CURVED PATH OF THE FRACTURE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF A HOOK-CRACK DEFECT.  THE DEPTH OF THE HOOK CRACK WAS 0.11 INCH, APPROXIMATELY 35-PERCENT OF THE NOMINAL WALL THICKNESS.  IN SUM, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE 2012 RUPTURE OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE WAS A 35-PERCENT THROUGH-WALL HOOK-CRACK MANUFACTURING DEFECT ADJACENT TO THE PIPE SEAM.        PART: A  9.

UPON DETERMINING THE STATUS OF THE INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCIDENT, A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (1043 MST) AND WAS ASSIGNED NRC REPORT NO.  997554.    AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS A RESULT OF FLAMMABLE VAPORS REACHING A SOURCE OF IGNITION DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF A TANK MIXER.  THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS DUE TO OPERATOR PERSONNEL FAILING TO FOLLOW REQUIRED MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AND POLICIES WHEN PERFORMING WORK WITHIN AN AREA WITH A POTENTIAL HAZARDOUS ATMOSPHERE.

CONTROL ROOM OPERATORS RECEIVED A SPILL CHECK ALARM ON TANK 1476 AT 11:00. WHILE RESPONDING TO THE ALARM, OPERATORS OBSERVED A PRODUCT/WATER MIXTURE FLOWING FROM THE ROOF DRAIN DISCHARGE PIPING. THEY IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE DIKE FOR TANK 1476 AND THE DISCHARGE PIPING OUTLET; AND NOTIFIED THE OPERATIONS MANAGER OF THE RELEASE.   THE SPILLED GASOLINE WAS INITIALLY CONTAINED WITHIN THE DIKE. TECHNICIANS, PROJECT INSPECTORS, AND CONTRACTORS IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED AND BEGAN PERFORMING ISOLATION AND INITIAL CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE TANK 1476 WAS NOT IN-USE AT THE TIME AND BECAUSE THE RELEASE DID NOT AFFECT LOCAL OPERATIONS, THE FACILITY WAS NOT SHUT-DOWN. AS FLOOD WATER LEVELS INCREASED AT THE FACILITY, OPERATIONS INCLUDING BOTH MAINLINE BOOSTER STATIONS WERE PROACTIVELY SHUTDOWN AND ISOLATED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:08.

THE VALVE WAS ISOLATED AND THE LEAK STOPPED AT 16:35.       IT WAS DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT DUE TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THE PRESSURE ON V-204.  THE MAIN METHOD OF ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION WAS THROUGH ELIMINATION.      VESSEL TEMPERATURE IS HAND RECORDED ONCE PER DAY BY READING A LOCAL TEMPERATURE GAUGE PLUS IS RECORDED ANY TIME A TRANSFER INTO OR OUT OF THE VESSEL IS RECORDED.  TANK GAUGED LEVELS ARE ALSO RECORDED AT THIS TIME.  THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON AUGUST 5 AND THE MAXIMUM TANK TEMPERATURE DURING THE 24 HOUR PERIOD OF AUGUST 5.    PIPELINE PRESSURE OPERATES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE 150-250 PSIG OF THE CHEM GRADE PROPYLENE BULLETS.  WHILE THERE WAS A SMALL SPIKE IN THE PIPELINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL RELEASE (&#8773;1220 PSIG VS. 1200) IT WAS PROBABLY NOT THE CAUSE OF THE INCREASED BULLET PRESSURE.  THERE WERE OTHER TIMES WHEN THE PIPELINE PRESSURE WENT UP TO 1220 PSIG WITH NO INCREASE IN BULLET PRESSURE.    C2/LIGHTS CONTAMINATION IN THE CHEM GRADE PROPYLENE PIPELINE WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING LOWER THAN NORMAL AND MUCH LOWER THAN THE SPECIFICATION OF 1000PPM.  LIGHTS WERE NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE OVERPRESSURE OF THE PRESSURE OF V-204.    V204 LIQUID LEVEL WAS AT THE UPPER END OF NORMAL WORKING RANGE LIMITS.  THERE WERE OTHER TIMES BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRESSURE EXCURSION WHERE THE VESSEL LEVEL WAS HIGH BUT DID NOT OVERPRESSURE.  THE HIGH LEVEL MAY HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR ASSUMING THE ROOT CAUSE WAS NON-CONDENSABLES (SUCH AS NITROGEN) IN THE VESSEL AND THERE WAS LESS AVAILABLE SPACE FOR AN ABNORMAL INERT IN THE SYSTEM CAUSING AN INCREASED PRESSURE.       CONCLUSION:  THE ROOT CAUSE OF INCREASED PRESSURE IN V-204 TO CAUSE THE RUPTURE DISC/JPV-3400 TO OPEN WAS INERTS/NON-CONDENSABLES COMING IN THROUGH THE CHEM GRADE PROPYLENE PIPELINE.

P66 IMPLEMENTED AN IMMEDIATE INTERIM COMPANY WIDE POLICY THAT TOR FITTING CAPS COULD NOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT APPROVAL FROM THE HSE MANAGER AND PIPELINES MANAGER.  PRIOR TO RESTARTING THE PIPELINE, PHILLIPS 66 SEAL WELDED THE CAPS ON THE 4 TOR FITTINGS IDENTIFIED WITHOUT PLUGS INSTALLED.      THE INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT FOUND THE ROOT CAUSE TO BE THAT (DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE TOR FITTING), A PLUG WAS NOT INSTALLED (UNDER THE CAP) AS CALLED FOR BY PROCEDURE.  THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IDENTIFIED WAS TO MODIFY THE PROCEDURE ON THE USE OF A TOR FITTING TO INCLUDE A STEP TO VERIFY PLUG INSTALLATION ON THE FITTING BY X-RAY PRIOR TO REMOVAL OF THE CAP.

THE LEAK WAS REPORTED BY A LAND OWNER. VANDALISM WAS THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. A LOCAL PRESSURE GAUGE AT VALVE SITE #5 ON THE PIPELINE WAS PUNCTURED BY A BULLET FIRED FROM A GUN.      BACKGROUND:    THE PIPELINE WAS BLOCKED IN AND NOT FLOWING WHEN THE GAUGE WAS SHOT AND INITIALLY STARTED LEAKING. ON 3/18/16 THE PIPELINE RESUMED FLOW AND SHORTLY AFTER THE PIPELINE RESTARTED THE CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE LEAK. THE CONTROL CENTER ISOLATED THE REMOTE VALVE AT THE START OF THE PIPELINE AT SUMMIT¿S DIVIDE STATION AND THE REMOTE VALVE AT THE END OF THE PIPELINE AT THE GLOBAL RAIL FACILITY. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF A PRESSURE DROP BY THE CONTROL ROOM.      RESPONSE AND AGENCY NOTIFICATION    A  SUMMIT REPRESENTATIVE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE VALVE SITE. UPON ARRIVAL, THE REPRESENTATIVE FOUND THE GAUGE LEAKING AN ISOLATED THE ½ INCH VALVE BELOW THE GAUGE TO STOP THE LEAK. AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE AREA WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE SOIL IMPACT. A DETERMINATION THROUGH SOIL CALCULATION MODELS SHOWED THE LEAK TO BE MINOR IN NATURE, 4.7 BARRELS, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT MEET PHMSA TELEPHONIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF $50,000 THRESHOLD. INSTEAD, THE REPORT WOULD BE FILED UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF PHMSA¿S 30 DAY NOTIFICATION. IT DID HOWEVER MEET THE NDIC AND NDDH REQUIREMENTS AND A REPORT WAS FILED WITH STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA.

ON MONDAY 3/21/2016, THE REMEDIATION CONTRACTOR RETURNED TO CONDUCT SOIL TESTING. TESTS CONCLUDED THAT THE OIL HAD MIGRATED FURTHER OUT THAN THE ORIGINAL DETERMINED. ON 3/22/2016 EVIDENCE WAS FOUND THAT THE OIL LEAK FOLLOWED THE PATH OF THE PIPE AND UNDERGROUND. ON 3/23/2016 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TESTING AND CLEANUP EFFORTS FOR THIS SPILL WOULD EXCEED $50,000 AND A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS MADE TO THE NCR NOTIFYING PHMSA OF THE QUALIFYING SPILL. THE SITE ASSESSMENT AND SPILL CALCULATIONS DETERMINED THE SPILL TO BE 103 BARRELS. SUMMIT REPORTED 150 BARREL WHICH WAS 1.5 TIMES THE ESTIMATED SPILL VOLUME TO GIVE PHMSA A WORST CASE ESTIMATE.

NORMAL OPERATIONS RESUMED AT 9:45 PM.     CAUSES:    - THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS A RUPTURE IN A 1/4"" SCHEDULE 10, TYPE 316L, STAINLESS STEEL TUBE DESIGNED TO RELIEVE PRODUCT PRESSURE FROM A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE.   - THE LOCAL TEMPERATURE DURING THE DAY OF THE RUPTURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 DEGREES F.     THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION:    - A ½¿ ROOT VALVE DESIGNED TO BE OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION WAS NEARLY CLOSED, NOT ALLOWING WATER TO DRAIN FROM THE TUBING LEG.   - THE SPLIT IN THE TUBING WAS DUE TO WATER FREEZING INSIDE THE TUBE CAUSING DUCTILE TEARING FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE GENERATED FROM THE EXPANSION OF WATER FREEZING INTO ICE.   - WATER WAS MOST LIKELY INTRODUCED FROM A METER PROVER CONNECTION.   - A WATER DRAW TEST WAS PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED ON THE PROVER AND RESIDUAL AMOUNTS OF WATER WERE NOT REMOVED.   - THE ½"" ROOT VALVE CONNECTING TO THE THERMAL RELIEF WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL DEVICE THAT SHOULD BE LEFT OPEN DURING NORMAL OPERATION.    CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:     - THE WATER DRAW PROCEDURE WILL BE REVISED WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTRACTOR TO DRY THE PROVER LOOP AFTER THE WATER DRAW.   - OPERATIONS WILL VERIFY NO FREE LIQUIDS ARE IN THE PROVER PRIOR TO INSTALLATION AFTER THE WATER DRAW TEST.

THE LINE WAS BLOCKED IN, EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE OBTAINED, AND THE RESIDUAL BLOWDOWN FROM THE ISOLATED LINE WAS MONITORED UNTIL COMPLETE AND VAPORS WERE CLEAR IN THE AREA.    THE RELEASE OF BUTANE WAS THE RESULT OF DAMAGE TO AN ABOVE GROUND 8"" VALVE, WHICH RELEASED LIQUID BUTANE, WHICH WAS CONVERTED TO VAPOR WHEN RELEASED TO ATMOSPHERE.  THE VOLUME OF BUTANE LIQUID RELEASED TO ATMOSPHERE IS ESTIMATED AT 140 BARRELS.  WATER VAPOR WAS FROZEN AT THE LEAK LOCATION AND ALONG THE FROZEN GROUND SURFACE.  THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AT 1145 HOURS.  LEL MONITORS WERE SET AT 1203 HOURS TO MONITOR FOR AIR IMPACTS IN THE RELEASE AREA.

RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT WATER TRAPPED INSIDE OF THE VALVE ON A DEAD LEG FROZE CAUSING EXPANSION WITHIN THE VALVE BODY LEADING TO THE SPLIT BODY VALVE BEING OPENED AT THE BOLTED SEAM CONNECTION.  THE RESIDUAL WATER REMAINED FROM A PREVIOUS HYDROSTATIC TEST IN AUGUST OF 2015.

Q: IS ENERGY XXI INVESTIGATION COMPLETE?   A: YES, THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.    Q: REPORT STATED THAT A VALVE WAS LEFT OPEN BY CONTRACT PERSONNEL.   A: ALL EXXI PIPELINE OPERATORS ARE CONTRACTORS AND THE OPERATOR IN QUESTION HAS BEEN WORKING SINCE MAY 7TH, 2014 WITH NO OTHER INCIDENTS OF OPERATOR ERROR. HYDROCARBON SAMPLES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE DOT BREAKOUT TANKS TYPICALLY (4) TIMES IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD. THIS SAMPLING IS ONE OF THE OPERATORS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES. HYDROCARBONS ARE SOLD FROM THIS LOCATION AND THE OPERATOR SAMPLING OF BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER IS ROUTINE.     Q: HOW DID EXXI ENSURE THAT THIS WILL NOT OCCUR AGAIN?   A: EXXI HAS PROVIDED ALL SUPERVISORS, OPERATORS, AND TECHNICIANS WITH ONSITE TRAINING THAT OCCURS INDIVIDUALLY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ASSOCIATING WITH THE SAMPLING OF BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER. THE LAST TRAINING OCCURRED IN OCTOBER 2015 AND THE NEXT SCHEDULED TRAINING IS OCTOBER 2016.       ADDITIONALLY, EXXI HAS ENHANCED THE PROCESS BY INSTALLING BULL PLUGS IN THE VALVE AFTER COLLECTING BASIC SEDIMENT AND WATER SAMPLES.     Q: ARE THERE PROCEDURES IN PLACE THAT GOVERN THE INSPECTION OF THIS VALVE?   A: THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATOR NOT CLOSING A HALF INCH BALL VALVE AFTER EXTRACTING A HYDROCARBON SAMPLE. THIS ACCIDENT WAS NOT THE RESULT OF AN IMPROPER INSPECTION OF THIS VALVE.     Q: WERE THESE PROCEDURES GIVEN TO THE CONTRACTOR?   A: YES, AND REVIEWED ANNUALLY.    ALSO, AFTER THE ACCIDENT THE OPERATOR IN QUESTION WAS SUBMITTED TO D&A TESTING WITHIN THE TIME GUIDELINES OF PHMSA. THE RESULTS OF THE TESTING WAS NEGATIVE.

ANALYSIS ALSO DETERMINED FOUR BASIC CAUSES:  1) INADEQUATE/IMPROPER ENGINEERING (IMPROPER DRAIN), 2) LACK OF PROCEDURES (NO PM OR MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES FOR OWS ALARM DEVICE), 3) LACK OF PROCEDURES (NO DRAIN-UP PROCEDURES FOR MARATHON INCOMING MANIFOLD), 4) LACK OF MOC. MULTIPLE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING ANALYSIS:  1) ISOLATE (COMPLETED) AND DEVELOP A PROJECT TO REMOVE THE DRAIN LINES FROM THE MARATHON INCOMING MANIFOLD TO THE OWS DISCHARGE PIPING, 2) ENSURE OWS PRODUCT DISCHARGE PIPING HAS PROPER VENT INSIDE SUMP TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FLOW (COMPLETED), 3) DEVELOP PROJECT TO EVALUATE PROPER ELEVATION GRADIENT ON THE DISCHARGE PIPING FROM THE OWS TO THE SUMP, 4) DEVELOP A PROJECT TO REMOVE THE DEAD LEG PIPING CREATED BY DECOMMISSIONING MARATHON LINES.

THE CRACK INITIATED THE HEAT-AFFECTED ZONE (HAZ) OF THE WELD CAP TOE ON THE REDUCER SIDE NEAR THE TOP BUTTON OF THE WELD. THIS CONCLUSION WAS BASED ON THE FLAT, SMOOTH APPEARANCE OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE AND THE STRAIGHT, PERPENDICULAR CRACK PROFILE WHEN VIEWED IN CROSS SECTION. THE CYCLICAL STRESSES WERE CONCLUDED TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM THE MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS INDUCED BY OPERATION OF THE #2 PUMP. THE STRESSES WERE CONCENTRATED AT THE WELD AS A RESULT OF THE PIPING CONFIGURATION WHICH CREATED A 4-INCH REDUCTION IN DIAMETER BETWEEN THE MAINLINE AND DEAD LEG IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF THE #2 PUMP. ADDITIONALLY, A RESIDUAL BENDING STRESS CREATED BY POOR FIT-UP OF THE 6-INCH MAINLINE AND 2-INCH DEAD LEG WAS CONCLUDED TO HAVE ELEVATED THE MEAN AMPLITUDE OF THE CYCLICAL STRESSES.  *HOW WAS THIS REPAIRED?  **THE FAILED PART AND DEAD LEG WERE REMOVED.  *WERE OTHER AREAS IDENTIFIED AND INSPECTED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE?   **NO ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF CONCERN WERE IDENTIFIED.",MATERIAL FAILURE OF PIPE OR WELD,,CRUDE OIL,2/2/15 13:24,"WESTERN REFINING PIPELINE, LLC",3/2/15,105,-107.747355,35.73235

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE GENERATED DURING THE IA PROCESS INCLUDING A REVIEW OF THE PROVER FILL PROCEDURE FOR ACCURACY AND USABILITY AND A REVIEW OF THE HMI ALARM SCHEME AT THE CONTROL ROOM.  THIS CONTROL ROOM REVIEW INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE ""ACKNOWLEDGE ALL"" ALARM FUNCTION WITH THE OPERATORS AND ITS INTENDED USE. A THIRD CORRECTIVE ACTION IDENTIFIED WAS THE ADDITION OF A SECONDARY OR ""MAX-FILL"" ALARM ON ALL THE STATION SUMPS.

LINE WAS EXCAVATED AND VERIFIED TO BE SR-41. LINE WAS CLAMPED. PLANS WERE PUT IN PLACE TO REPAIR AND HYDROTEST THE PIPELINE.    SUMMARY OF LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS:  THE SUBMITTED PIPE SECTION FAILED IN SERVICE DUE TO CORROSION THAT PERFORATED THE PIPELINE WALL AT THE OD SURFACE.  THE MAJORITY OF THE CORROSION PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN VARIOUS IRON OXIDES.  EXAMINATION OF THE RECEIVED SAMPLE IDENTIFIED THE LEAK FAILURE TO BE TWO LONGITUDINAL PERFORATIONS CHARACTERISTIC OF SELECTIVE WELD SEAM (ERW) CORROSION NEAR THE 4:16 O¿CLOCK POSITION (AS REPORTED BY THE FIELD).    IN GENERAL, SELECTIVE SEAM CORROSION IS A LOCALIZED CORROSION ATTACK ALONG THE BOND LINE OF ERW PIPING THAT LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WEDGE SHAPED GROOVE THAT IS OFTEN FILLED WITH CORROSION PRODUCTS.  THE MATERIAL AT THE BOND LINE IS ANODIC TO THE SURROUNDING MATERIAL AND THE RESULT IS A V-SHAPED GROOVE WITH THE APEX OF THE V CENTERED ON THE BOND LINE.       PER VISUAL EXAMINATION, THE LINE DID NOT SHOW ANY EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL CORROSION.  THOUGH THIS WAS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ANY WATER OR CONTAMINANTS IN THE PIPELINE PRODUCT TO DROP OUT AT RELATIVE LOW SPOTS AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO INTERNAL ISSUES.  PRIOR TO 2008, THE LINE WAS OPERATED 3-4 TIMES PER WEEK.  SINCE THAT TIME THE LINE HAS ONLY BEEN UTILIZED 3-4 TIMES PER YEAR WITH THE LAST OPERATIONAL DATE BEING 9/8/2014.  THE SOURCE OF PRESSURE ON THE LINE IS FROM THE BARGE PUMP, AND TYPICAL OFFLOADING PRESSURES ARE BETWEEN 80-90 PSIG.  THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT EVEN WHEN THE LINE DOES FLOW, DEPOSITS AND WATER BUILD UP MAY NOT BE SWEPT OUT OF THE LOW SPOTS.  CORROSION COUPONS WERE INSTALLED IN DECEMBER 2014; HOWEVER, THE COUPONS REQUIRE LONGER PIPELINE FLUID EXPOSURE TIME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ANY VALUABLE INFORMATION CONCERNING INTERNAL CONDITIONS.      THE PIPE MATERIAL MET THE COMPOSITION REQUIREMENTS OF API 5L 10TH EDITION, GRADES A AND B CARBON STEEL.

HPC SENT DOCUMENTATION AND GIS FILES TO SHOW THE LOCATION OF THEIR PIPELINE.  3/21/14 - HPC SENT DIVERS OUT TO THE LEAK LOCATION.  DIVERS REPAIRED THE LEAK WITH A CLAMP BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO LOCATE HPC¿S PIPELINE THAT DAY DUE TO DELAYS FROM BAD WEATHER. HPC HAD DIVERS ON STANDBY TO LOCATE HPC¿S LINE WHEN WEATHER PERMITTED.    3/25/14 - USCG INFORMED HPC OF A NEW SHEEN ON THE WATER.  HPC CONTRACTED THE DIVE CREW THAT WAS ON STANDBY FOR LOCATING HPC¿S PIPELINE TO INVESTIGATE THE SUSPECTED LEAK SOURCE AND PERFORM ANY NECESSARY REPAIRS AS SOON AS WEATHER PERMITTED.   3/27/14 - DIVERS REPLACED A PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED CLAMP, CYCLED THE HELIS FACILITY PUMPS AND OBSERVED NO FURTHER SHEENS.  HPC OPERATOR¿S WERE ON-SITE AND REPORTED THERE WAS NO VISIBLE SHEEN OR SIGNS OF A LEAK IN THE AREA AFTERWARDS.  HPC CONTRACTED T. BAKER TO PERFORM A MAGNETOMETER/JET PROBE SURVEY OF THE LINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HPC DEPLOYED HARD AND SOFT BOOM AROUND THE LEAK SITE AND HAD PERSONNEL ON-SITE EVERY DAY UNTIL THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.  ALL SHEENS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT HAVE DISSIPATED.     3/28/14 - HPC WAS SERVED WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER FROM THE USCG.  HPC¿S EH&S MANGER RESPONDED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER SENDING A LETTER VIA EMAIL TO THE USCG.  HPC STATED THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE USCG SINCE LATE 2013 TO INVESTIGATE AND REPAIR AN INTERMITTENT LEAK IN BLACK BAY, LOUISIANA.  WHILE THE LINE¿S OWNERSHIP WAS STILL NOT CLEAR, HPC HAS AND WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PROTECT THE AREA¿S SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES.  HPC DEPLOYED HARD AND SOFT BOOM AROUND THE LEAK SITE AND WOULD HAVE PERSONNEL ON-SITE UNTIL THIS ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.  3/31/14 - LDNR WENT OUT TO THE SITE WITH HPC FIELD PERSONNEL AND REVIEWED LINE SURVEY ALONG WITH JET PROBING.  SOME PICTURES WERE TAKEN OF THE BIRDCAGE AND HELIS PLATFORM.  LDNR HEADED BACK IN TO SHORE BECAUSE WEATHER WAS GETTING ROUGH.  PIPELINE SURVEY WORK WOULD CONTINUE WITH TBS AS WEATHER PERMITS. 4/5/2014 - HPC OPERATIONS ENGINEER REPORTED TO THE USCG AT APPROX. 10 AM THAT THE LEAK WAS BELIEVED TO BE HPC¿S BLACK BAY 8¿ PIPELINE BUT WAS WAITING FOR FINAL VERIFICATION FROM THE SURVEY CREW THAT WAS OUT THERE JETTING AND SURVEYING HPC¿S PIPELINE.  4/7/2014 - USCG REQUESTED HPC HOLD A REPAIR PLAN MEETING WITH THEM SOMETIME DURING THE WEEK OF THE 3/7/14.  A REPAIR PLAN WAS CREATED JUST IN CASE THE TBS DID CONFIRM THAT THIS WAS A HPC PIPELINE.   4/8/14 - A REPAIR PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO THE USCG BY THE OPERATIONS ENGINEER.

CPL PERSONNEL MARKED THE TWO CPL LINES IN A PLANTED COTTON FIELD. THE LEGACY MAPS OF THE LINES FAILED TO INDICATE THAT THE TWO LINES CROSSED IN THE FIELD, SO CPL PERSONNEL THOUGHT THAT THE TWO LINES WERE PARALLEL THROUGH THE FIELD. A KINDER MORGAN 8"" PIPELINE, ALSO LOCATED 10' TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CPL 6"" LINE AND DIRECTLY ABOVE THE CPL 8"" LINE WAS NEVER FLAGGED OR IDENTIFIED TO EITHER THE FERGUSON CREW OR CPL PERSONNEL. THE FERGUSON EXCAVATION CREW ARRIVED AT THE FIRST OF THE FLAGGED LINES ON JANUARY 30, 2014. CPL PERSONNEL WERE ON SITE AS THE FERGUSON CREW HAND DUG AROUND THE FIRST LINE. BASED ON THE MAP, THE CPL TECH EXPECTED THIS LINE TO BE THE CPL 8"" LINE.  HOWEVER, THIS WAS A 6"" PIPELINE.  THE FERGUSON CREW EXCAVATED AROUND THIS LINE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE CPL TECH INSTRUCTED THE CREW TO HAND DIG THE NEXT LINE UNTIL THE LINE WAS FULLY EXPOSED.  THIS LINE WAS ALSO A 6"" LINE. THE CPL TECH EXPECTED THIS TO BE THE 8"" CPL LINE.  HE BECAME ALARMED AND ORDERED THE CREW TO CEASE EXCAVATION UNTIL THE 8"" LINE COULD BE IDENTIFIED.  THE FERGUSON CREW COMPLIED AND SHUT DOWN THE TRACK-HOE.  THE FERGUSON CREW MOVED TO THE NORTH AND HAND DUG TO EXPOSE MORE OF THIS LINE, WHICH WAS AN 8"" LINE.

THE TRACK-HOE OPERATOR THEN COMPLETED THE EXCAVATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 8"" LINE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE CPL PIPELINE, LYING DIRECTLY UNDER THIS LINE, WAS NOT SEEN BY THE EXCAVATING CREW AT THIS POINT.

DUE TO THIS IDLE STATUS, THERE WAS NO LARGE SPRAY OF OIL. THE OIL FLOWED INTO THE 15' DEEP EXCAVATION AND WAS TOTALLY CONTAINED THERE.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO PERSONNEL, NO DAMAGE TO ANY EQUIPMENT, NO FIRE AND NO OVERLAND OIL FLOW.

THE MAJOR REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE UNFILLED CAVITY IN THE ROOT PASS, WHICH CREATED A HUGE STRESS RISER ON THE PIPE INTERNAL SURFACE AND DECREASED THE EFFECTIVE WALL THICKNESS. SMALL CRACKS DEVELOPED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ROOT CAVITY DURING SERVICE. WITH TIME, THEY MET WITH THE HAZ CRACKS FROM THE TOP, LEADING TO A THROUGH CRACK.  THE UNFILLED CAVITY IN THE ROOT PASS IS CAUSED BY SLAG INCLUSION, WHICH WAS NOT PROPERLY CLEANED BEFORE THE REPAIR WELDING PROCEDURE.  IN THIS CASE, MOST LIKELY, THE HAZ CRACKS WERE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT PREHEAT TEMPERATURE DURING REPAIR WELDING. SINCE THE CRACKS ARE SMALL, THEY WERE MISSED BY VISUAL EXAMINATION AND X-RAY.

THE TECHNICIAN CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE.  ANALYSIS HAS DETERMINED THAT A PARTIALLY BURIED VALVE EXPERIENCED A MECHANICAL FAILURE OF A THREADED CONNECTION IN ITS CAST BODY.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT A PRE-EXISTING FLAW IN THE 1950¿S VINTAGE VALVE BODY CASTING REDUCED THE THREADED ENGAGEMENT LENGTH, DIMINISHING THE FRICTIONAL FORCES RETAINING THE ½¿ PLUG ALLOWING IT TO BACK OUT. THE IMPACTED AREA WAS REMEDIATED AND THE VALVE WAS REPLACED.    THE METALLURGICAL CAUSE OF THE LEAK COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE PLUG WAS NOT RECOVERED FROM THE LEAK SITE. FIVE POSSIBLE FAILURE SCENARIOS WERE CONSIDERED AND ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. FAILURE SCENARIOS 1, 4, AND 5 CAN BE RULED OUT.     FAILURE SCENARIO 1 ¿ THE PLUG WAS NEVER INSERTED FOLLOWING MAINTENANCE IN 2002. THIS SCENARIO WAS RULED OUT BASED ON BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM BP. THE VALVE WOULD HAVE LEAKED IF THE PLUG WAS NOT IN THE DRAIN PORT, AND THE LEAK WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED.     FAILURE SCENARIO 4 ¿ THE PLUG BLEW OUT DURING OPERATION. THIS SCENARIO WAS RULED OUT SINCE THE THREADS OF PORT 1 WERE NOT SHEARED OFF. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO THE THREADS TO SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO.     FAILURE SCENARIO 5 ¿ COMPLETE CORROSION OF THE INTERNAL THREADS OCCURRED AND THE PLUG FELL OUT. THIS SCENARIO WAS RULED OUT SINCE ONLY A PORTION OF THE THREADS OF PORT 1 WAS CORRODED, AND A MAJORITY OR ALL OF THE THREADS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE PLUG WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRODED.     FAILURE SCENARIO 3 ¿ THE PLUG BLEW OUT DURING OPERATION BECAUSE THE THREADS WERE CORRODED. THIS SCENARIO HAS A LOW LIKELIHOOD. SINCE ROLLED MATERIAL, WHICH COULD BE SIMILAR TO THE MATERIAL OF A CARBON STEEL PLUG, WAS SELECTIVELY ATTACKED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A CARBON STEEL PLUG COULD HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. ALSO, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A NON-CARBON STEEL PLUG, THAT IS ANODIC TO STEEL, WAS INSERTED DURING THE MAINTENANCE IN 2002. SINCE THE OTHER TWO DRAIN PLUGS WERE DETERMINED TO COMPOSED OF CARBON STEEL, THIS IS NOT LIKELY.     THEREFORE, THIS SCENARIO IS POSSIBLE, BUT IS NOT CONSIDERED LIKELY.     FAILURE SCENARIO 2 ¿ THE PLUG BACKED OUT DURING OPERATION. THIS SCENARIO IS THE MOST LIKELY OF THE FIVE SCENARIOS. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR THIS SCENARIO INCLUDES THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO BP, THE VALVE WAS SUBJECTED TO VIBRATIONS AND 2) THE THREADS OF THE PORT THAT LEAKED ARE NOT COMPLETELY CORRODED AWAY OR SHEARED OFF. AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THERE WAS NO MECHANICAL DAMAGE OF THE THREADS TO SUPPORT SHEARING OFF AND A MAJORITY OR ALL OF THE THREADS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE PLUG WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRODED.

THE LOSS OF INTEGRITY OF THE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS WAS THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE OF THE CRUDE OIL.    AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT WAS CONDUCTED.  BY CONDUCTING A CAUSE AND EFFECT ANALYSIS, THE TEAM IDENTIFIED SEVERAL CAUSES WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT.  THESE ARE LISTED AS FOLLOWS:  1.  THE INSTRUCTION IN THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE (TFRHYDVLV) TO ""VERIFY WITH OMC THAT THE VALVE CAN BE OPENED   AND CLOSED PRIOR TO BEGINNING PM"" WAS NOT PERFORMED PRIOR TO OPERATING THE INLET VALVE FOR TANK 6416.   2.

O THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS CRACK HAD GROWN AS A RESULT OF FATIGUE, SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS CRACK HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION.  O IT IS NOT EVIDENT WHAT CAUSED THE CRACK TO LEAK WHEN IT DID.  SOME FORM OF AXIAL STRESS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY (I.E. SOIL MOVEMENT, BENDING).    UPDATE FROM FINAL REPORT MARCH 14, 2014  THE LEAK IN GIRTH WELD 71+64 WAS CAUSED BY A CRACK THAT INITIATED AT AN AREA OF INADEQUATE PENETRATION (IP) AND INCOMPLETE FUSION (IF) AT THE WELD ROOT NEAR THE TOP BUTTON OF THE GIRTH WELD. THE IP AND IF DEFECTS ACTED AS STRESS CONCENTRATORS. AT THE SAME POSITION ON THE GIRTH WELD, A REPAIR WAS VISUALLY EVIDENT. REPAIRS TYPICALLY REPRESENT A STRESS CONCENTRATION BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL RESTRAINT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE WELD REPAIR CAVITY. BOTH THE BASE WELD AND REPAIR WELD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED USING THE GAS METAL ARC WELDING (GMAW) PROCESS.  THE IP AND IF DEFECTS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE CRACK HAD ENLARGED IN SERVICE (E.G. FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH), SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THE CRACK THROUGH THE REPAIR WELD WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, SOME OTHER MECHANISM MUST HAVE CAUSED THE FINAL FAILURE OF A THIN REMAINING LIGAMENT OR SOME AXIAL STRESS MUST HAVE CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN SLIGHTLY, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE. THE PRECISE REASON FOR THE LEAK OCCURRING WHEN IT DID IS NOT OBVIOUS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE NO REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS VISIBLE ON THE FRACTURE SURFACE, THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO WAS AN INCREASE IN THE AXIAL STRESS ACTING ON THE GIRTH WELD, SUCH AS SOIL MOVEMENT OR SETTLEMENT, WHICH CAUSED THE CRACK TO OPEN ENOUGH TO LEAK.",MATERIAL FAILURE OF PIPE OR WELD,,REFINED AND/OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT (NON-HVL) WHICH IS A LIQUID AT AMBIENT CONDITIONS,5/11/13 13:30,"BUCKEYE PARTNERS, LP",5/24/13,1,-82.167048,41.274678

THE LEAK WAS THEN ISOLATED BETWEEN AM 32 AND AM 35 AND THE REMAINING PRODUCTS WERE FLARED.  ONCE THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE, THE LINE WAS EXPOSED TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF EXCAVATION TO CUT-OUT AND REPLACE THE PIPE.  THE LINE WAS PURGED AND RESTARTED ON 11/8/2012.    PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS  THE CUT-OUT SECTION WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR EXAMINATION.  PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE PIPE CUT-OUT VIA MACRO-SECTIONING DETERMINED THERE ARE NO LAMINATIONS, SEGREGATIONS, AND / OR ANOMALIES WITHIN THE BODY OF THE PIPE.  PRE & POST INCIDENT NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION VERIFIED WALL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF THE PIPE WERE WITHIN THE APPROVED PARAMETERS.  PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS USING A MICROMETER OF THE PIPE WERE CONDUCTED AFTER SECTIONING ALSO CONFIRMED THE WALL THICKNESS WAS ACCEPTABLE.  BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THE WELDING INSPECTOR AND WELDERS AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE WELDING INSPECTOR, THE WELDERS WERE NOT BEING FULLY MONITORED DURING THE WELDING OPERATION. IT HAS ALSO BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE WELDERS WERE WELDING OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED PARAMETER RANGES.  SEVERAL MACRO-SECTIONS WERE TAKEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED FROM AREAS BOTH OUTSIDE AND OF CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION.  THE PHOTOGRAPHS INDICATE THAT PREVIOUS PASSES FROM THE RESPONSIBLE WELDER WERE WELDED WITHIN ACCEPTABLE WELDING PARAMETERS.  AS THE MACRO-SECTIONS MOVED CLOSER TO THE BURN-THROUGH LOCATION IT CAN BE NOTED THAT THE OVERALL ENERGY INPUTTED INTO THE PIPE REGION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PASSES.  A FINAL REPORT IS PENDING FROM THE LAB ANALYSIS.    METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS FINDINGS  THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONCLUDED ""THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS BURN-THROUGH IS THE POOR WELDING PRACTICE OF THE SUBJECT WELDER.  HE USED EXCESSIVE HEAT INPUT IN HIS WELDING OPERATIONS.  HE CONSISTENTLY DEPOSITED LARGE BEADS AND PENETRATED DEEP INTO THE PIPE.  THIS WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE LAST ROD HE DEPOSITED.""

THE FEATURE AT THIS SITE WAS PREDICTED TO BE 16% WALL LOSS. BECAUSE THE ANOMALY WAS LOCATED INSIDE A CASING, A PROJECT WAS PUT IN PLACE TO CUT OUT THE ANOMALY AND REPLACE THE SECTION WITH NEW PIPE, AND WITH EVALUATION OF THE ANOMALY TO BE PERFORMED AFTER THE REPLACEMENT WAS COMPLETED. ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, THE AREA OPERATIONS EMPLOYEE VISITED THE PROPOSED DIG SITE AT WOLF ROAD PIPELINE CROSSING TO EVALUATE THE SCOPE OF WORK FOR THE UPCOMING ANOMALY INVESTIGATION. WHILE ON SITE, THE EMPLOYEE IDENTIFIED STAINING ON THE VENT PIPE AND DID A LEL TEST, WHICH TESTED POSITIVE FOR HYDROCARBONS. INITIAL SAMPLES WERE GATHERED BY SIPHONING A SAMPLE FROM THE VENT PIPE AND ANALYZED BY A THIRD PARTY. THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED CHARACTERISTICS CONSISTENT WITH NAPTHA, WHICH WAS NOT A PRODUCT BEING TRANSPORTED BY THAT PIPELINE. WITH THIS INFORMATION, ONEOK PROCEEDED WITH THE PREPARATION FOR THE ANOMALY EXCAVATION. ON NOV. 1, THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00 A.M.

ALTHOUGH ONEOK DID NOT BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RELEASE FROM ITS PIPELINE, THE CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE EXCAVATION WAS LOADED INTO ROLL-OFF CONTAINERS AND SENT TO A DISPOSAL SITE. ON NOV. 3-4, THE PIPELINE SECTION CONTAINING THE ANOMALY WAS REMOVED FROM CASING AND NEW PIPE INSTALLED THROUGH THE EXISTING CASING. THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 12:00 P.M. ON NOV. 4.

THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON MARCH 10, 2011, DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF A 16""  TANK VALVE, THE BOOSTER PUMP HAD BEEN USED TO LOWER THE OIL LEVEL BELOW THE NOZZLE ELEVATION. MAINTENANCE CREWS TRIED TO THROTTLE THE DISCHARGE VALVE AS THE OIL LEVEL APPROACHED THE LOW SUCTION SO THE BOOSTER WOULD NOT SUCK AIR AND LOOSE ITS PRIME.

THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE EXCEEDED THE SUMP CAPACITY CAUSING IT TO OVERFLOW.  AN ALARM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUMP FAILED TO ACTIVATE.       THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS REPLACED AND RE-PIPED TO RELIEVE INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN A SUMP.  THE FAILURES RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    AS DESCRIBED IN THE INITIAL REPORT, THIS INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF A THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO RE-SEAT AFTER ACTIVATING.  THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE IS INSTALLED BETWEEN A PUMP DISCHARGE AND BACK PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE.  THE CONTROL VALVE WAS ORIGINALLY AIR OPERATED.  DUE TO EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, THE OLD CONTROL VALVE WAS REPLACED BY A NEW, ELECTRIC MOTOR OPERATED VALVE.   WHEN THE ELECTRIC OPERATED VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE ELECTRONIC TECHNICIAN SET THE VALVE TO CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED.  THE AIR OPERATED CONTROL VALVE DID NOT CLOSE COMPLETELY WHEN THE PIPELINE PUMP WAS STOPPED. THUS, AFTER THE ELECTRIC OPERATED CONTROL VALVE WAS INSTALLED, THE PUMP WAS STARTING AGAINST A SHUT VALVE.  THIS REDUCED THE STARTING CURRENT IN THE PUMP MOTOR BUT ALSO CAUSED THE PRESSURE IN THE LINE BETWEEN THE PUMP AND VALVE TO RISE TO A LEVEL THAT CAUSED THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE TO ACTIVATE UNTIL THE CONTROL VALVE OPENED ENOUGH TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW THE THERMAL RELIEF TO RE-SEAT.   THE RELIEF VALVE SETTING IS 550 PSIG, THE MOP OF THE LINE IS 800 PSIG AND THE PUMP SHUTOFF HEAD IS 620 PSIG.  THIS STARTUP PROCEDURE WAS OCCURRING FOR SOME TIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT.  THE REPEATED ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE DURING SYSTEM STARTUP COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT NOT RE-SEATING.    THE FLOW RATE FROM THE THERMAL RELIEF NOT RE-SEATING EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF THE SMALL SUMP PUMP.  THIS RESULTED IN A CONTINUALLY RISING LEVEL IN THE SUMP WHICH ULTIMATELY OVERFLOWED, CAUSING THE RELEASE.  ALTHOUGH EQUIPPED WITH A HIGH SUMP LEVEL ALARM, THE ALARM FAILED TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR BECAUSE THE ALARM FLOAT BECAME STUCK CAUSING THE ALARM SWITCH NOT TO ACTIVATE.      AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT, SEVERAL ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT:    -A REVIEW OF THE STARTUP PROTOCOL FOR THIS SYSTEM WAS CONDUCTED.  AS A RESULT THE CONTROL VALVE SETTING WAS CHANGED SO THAT THE VALVE DID NOT SHUT COMPLETELY WHEN THE PUMP IS SHUTDOWN.  THIS IS ALLOWING FLOW THROUGH THE VALVE UPON STARTUP AND MAINTAINING THE PRESSURE UPSTREAM OF THE VALVE BELOW THE SETTING OF THE THERMAL RELIEF VALVE;  -A ""EXCESSIVE RUN TIME"" ALARM FEATURE WAS INSTALLED ON THE SUMP PUMP TO ALERT THE CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR WHEN THE SUMP PUMP IS RUNNING LONGER THAN - NORMAL; AND   -A NEW THERMAL RELIEF VALVE WAS INSTALLED AND ITS DISCHARGE RE-PIPED TO RELIEF INTO A STORAGE TANK RATHER THAN THE SMALL SUMP.",EQUIPMENT FAILURE,,CRUDE OIL,10/15/11 11:00,"PLAINS PIPELINE, L.P.",11/14/11,73,-102.617793,31.960602

NO PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF CENTURION CONTROLLED PROPERTY WAS IMPACTED BY THIS RELEASE.  AFTER IMMEDIATE AND CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF THE RELEASE, CENTURION PROPERLY NOTIFIED THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, PHMSA, AND EPA.  FURTHER, CENTURION HAD AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (""ERP"") IN PLACE AND APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS OF THE ERP PROCEDURES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT. UPON DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE, CENTURION EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY ASSESSED THE SITUATION, VERIFIED NO POTENTIAL TO IMPACT SENSITIVE AREAS, ATTEMPTED TO MITIGATE FURTHER RELEASE BY STOPPING THE FLOW OF OIL, AND RESPONDED WITH QUICK CLEAN-UP OF THE AREA BY DEPLOYING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESPONSE RESOURCES.  IN ADDITION, CENTURION CONDUCTED A TAP ROOT INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT.  AN OUTSIDE METALLURGIST ALSO ANALYZED THE HINGE PIN ASSEMBLY ON THE JENSEN MIXER.  BOTH DETERMINED THAT EQUIPMENT FAILURE WAS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE HINGE PIN MECHANISM ON A JENSEN MIXER HAD FAILED, CAUSING A SEPARATION OF THE MIXER FROM THE TANK.     IN ACCORDANCE WITH CENTURION POLICY, AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED. CENTURION IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN ALL JENSEN MIXERS WITH SUSPECTED HINGE PIN MECHANISMS.   CENTURION IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL JENSEN MIXERS THAT USE THE SAME HINGE PIN MECHANISM AS THE ONE FOUND ON TANK 6688.  CENTURION IS NOT RESTARTING ANY JENSEN MIXER THAT HAS NOT HAD THE PIN ASSEMBLY REPLACED.

A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED ON 4/26/10 FOUND CONTAMINATED SOIL IN THE VICINITY OF THE TANK SUMP AND NEAR AN 11-INCH FLOOR CRACK.  THE PATTERN OF THE IMPACTED SOIL UNDER THE TANK INDICATED THAT THE CONTAMINATION RESULTED FROM A RELEASE FROM THE 11-INCH CRACK.      ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE SUMP FLOATED DUE TO POOR DRAINAGE OF SURFACE WATER AROUND THE TANK. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY FLEXING OF THE TANK BOTTOM CAUSED BY FLOTATION OF THE SUMP.  CORROSION ON THE SOIL SIDE AND PRODUCT SIDE OF THE FLOOR PLATES PROVIDED STRESS CONCENTRATORS FOR THE FATIGUE TO AFFECT.

THE PIPELINE WAS NOT OPERATING, AND THE PIPELINE OPERATORS ISOLATED THE LEAK FROM THE OIL STORAGE TANKS. APPROXIMATELY 12,000 GAL ULTIMATELY LEAKED TO A DIKED AREA. LATER, APPROXIMATELY 8,000 GAL OF THIS OIL WAS RECOVERED AND RETURNED TO THE STORAGE TANKS. MITIGATION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

THE GASKET WAS GARLOCK IFG-5500 AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE A PRODUCT SUITABLE FOR THIS APPLICATION. IT HAD NOT BEEN IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AND SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED AT LESS THAN 110% OF MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE. MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE IS 960 PSIG. THE FAILED JOINT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY HYDO TESTED ABOVE 1350 PSIG IN 2005.    A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND DETERMINED THAT A SMALL SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 9 FT) OF ABOVE GROUND PIPING WAS ISOLATED BY CLOSED VALVES. THIS UN-INSULATED BLACK PIPE HEATED IN THE SUN CAUSING A PRESSURE RISE THAT RESULTED IN THE GASKET FAILURE. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS INADEQUATE PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWED THE SECTION OF PIPING TO BE ISOLATED. SINCE THE FAILED GASKET WAS ISOLATED FROM THE FLOW METERS AND PRESSURE INSTRUMENTS THAT FEED THE SCADA AND LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS, THERE WAS NO CONTROL SYSTEM INDICATION OF A LEAK. FOLLOWING THE GASKET FAILURE, TANK HEAD PRESSURE ALLOWED FLOW THROUGH A CHECK VALVE AND OUT THOUGH THE FAILED GASKET. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE: GASKET MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT PER SPECIFICATION, FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE PRIOR MINOR FLANGE LEAKS AND AMBIENT HEATING INCIDENTS AND APPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED, LIGHTING THAT WAS PARTIALLY NON-FUNCTIONAL, AND CHANGES IN PIPELINE OPERATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED IN EXTENDED PIPELINE SHUTDOWNS.

THE OIL WAS CONFINED TO THE CRUSHED STONE AND SNOW-COVERED GROUND IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE PUMP UNIT ON THE PUMP STATION  PROPERTY. NO OIL ESCAPED COMPANY PROPERTY OR REACHED SURFACE WATERS. THE OIL WAS DISCOVERED DURING THE NEXT SCHEDULED INSPECTION, AND THE PUMP UNIT WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN. ALL OIL WAS RECOVERED BY HAND AND VACUUM EXCAVATION OF THE OILED SNOW, CRUSHED STONE, AND SOIL; THE RECOVERED MATERIALS WERE RECYCLED.    THE CAUSE OF THE SCAVENGER BOX OVERFLOW WAS THAT THE DRAIN LINE FROM THE SCAVENGER BOX HAD BECOME PARTIALLY PLUGGED WITH SANDY SEDIMENT FROM THE CRUDE OIL BEING PUMPED, AND IN THE SUBSEQUENT COLD WEATHER THE CRUDE OIL DRAINING THROUGH THE LINE CONGEALED AROUND THE SEDIMENT, BLOCKING THE DRAIN. AFTER THE INCIDENT, THE DRAIN LINE WAS DISASSEMBLED, THOROUGHLY CLEANED, AND REINSTALLED. THE PUMP WAS ALSO DISASSEMBLED AND THE SEALS WERE INSPECTED AND REPLACED WITH NEW PARTS TO REDUCE THE LEAKAGE THROUGH THE SEAL, THOUGH THE LEVEL OF WEAR WAS NOT UNUSUAL.",EQUIPMENT FAILURE,,CRUDE OIL,1/4/10 8:30,PORTLAND PIPELINE CORP,1/21/10,0.12,-70.49336,43.94028
